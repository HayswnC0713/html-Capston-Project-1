    <h2>Summary:</h2>
    <p> Hi, my name is Hayden and I am an aspiring entrepreneur with a passion for creating innovative solutions in the e-commerce industry. I have a dream to build a virtual version of an e-commerce platform, inspired by platforms like Taobao, but with a unique twist. My focus is on integrating virtual currencies into the platform to enable transactions. </p>
    <p>I believe that virtual currencies have the potential to revolutionize the way we conduct business and provide practical utility beyond just investment purposes. With this vision in mind, I have embarked on my first capstone project to learn HTML and create a website for my business.</p>
    <p>Through this project, I aim to combine my passion for e-commerce, technology, and virtual currencies to create a user-friendly platform that allows people to buy and sell real-world products using digital assets. I am excited about the potential of this venture and the positive impact it can have on the e-commerce landscape. 
    <p>I am eager to learn and grow throughout this journey, and I am committed to bringing my vision to life.</p>
